# Movie Collection Sagas

## Description

_Duration: 22 hour Sprint_

I Made an app that will allow you to keep track of some movies as well as the poster and the description. Using React router to have different pages to be able to have a better view of the description of the movies as well as seeing what genre category you would put them in.

### Prerequisites

Link to software that is required to install the app (e.g. node).

## Installation

1. Create a database named `saga_movies_weekend`,
2. The queries in the `database.sql` file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries, 
3. Open up your editor of choice and run an `npm install`
4. Run `npm run server` in your terminal
5. Run `npm run client` in your terminal
6. The `npm run client` command will open up a new browser tab for you!

## Usage

1. Look through the movie catalog
2. Click on a poster to go into a detailed view
3. In detailed view you are able to edit to change the genres or title and description.
4. You are able to add movies with the add movie button
